This program uses tracking of Aruco marker by calculating its velocity, average velocity at each vertex (This program tracks each corner of the aruco marker unlike the predefined track function in OpenCV, so as to detect the rotation at each vertex, whereas the predefined function tracks only rectangles). If Aruco dictionary fails to detect the marker, we estimate the position of each vertex using the previously calculated average velocity. If there are more than one Aruco marker, we store each of velocities in a dictionary with the key as its marker ID(For this reason there cannot be more than one marker with the same ID).
